Firstly, you need to install real-time software mikSYS. The order is:

3) Display (Frontend) software- Setup_Display(x64).exe, according to your system;

Next you'll see a bunch of shotcuts on your Desktop. Select shortcut "MWBridge", go to it's properties and in field "Target" write paths to MWBridge software and project folder, similar to this:
- "C:\Program Files (x86)\MikSYS\MWBRIDGE.exe" C:\Users\nssnikolas\Documents\GitHub\nto-nuclear-2023\project\database

You're full set to start the project!

2) Right-click on it, you'll open main window with parameters;
3) Launch "Display(x64)" (according to your system) you'll see user interface of the simulation.
